- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rudra Das from India
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Science and technology, Web development
I was initially interested in AI and Machine Learning, but I dont know how I became a cybersecurity researcher instead of data scientist.
Looking to learn from developers, intermediate, experts or beginners. Learning never ends...

`Also a Cybersecurity Researcher participating in multiple bug bounty programs!`
