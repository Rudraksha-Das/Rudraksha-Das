Whether you are a human or bot, it doesn't matter.

Iâ€™m Rudra Das from India

Iâ€™m interested in Science and technology, Web development and lerning new things from any where.

I was initially interested in AI and Machine Learning, but I dont know how I became a cybersecurity researcher instead of data scientist.

Looking to learn from developers, intermediate, experts or beginners. Learning never ends...

Still I don't know entire javascript, yet I found content spoofing bugs on several websites of Government of US [The target domain names are to be kept confidentialðŸ¤«]
Saved a health department websites belonging to Government of India from a major data breach, and secured some other websites belonging to the Government from multiple other security issues.

Age is just a number. I am not even 16, yet I have such achievements in my bucket.
